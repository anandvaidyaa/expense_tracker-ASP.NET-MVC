This Expense Tracker application is a feature-rich web application that has been built using the ASP.NET MVC framework. The user interface of the application is designed using Syncfusion components, which provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The application uses toastr notifications to inform the user of various events and Font Awesome icons to make the interface more intuitive.

One of the key features of the application is its ability to perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations, allowing users to manage their expenses with ease. The application also includes validation for user input, ensuring that only accurate and complete data is entered.

The application is divided into three main forms, each designed to manage a specific aspect of expense tracking. The Categories form allows users to create and manage different categories of expenses. The Transactions form allows users to record and view their expenses. Lastly, the Setting Expense Limit form allows users to set limits for their expenses, providing an additional level of financial control.
